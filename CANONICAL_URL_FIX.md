# Canonical URL Fix Summary

## Issue
The project was missing canonical URLs, which could cause search engines to rank duplicate pages and negatively impact SEO.

## Changes Made

### 1. Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added `metadataBase: new URL('https://www.aiasmr.vip')` to fix social media image warnings
- Added `alternates: { canonical: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip' }` for homepage canonical URL
- Added `url: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip'` to OpenGraph metadata

### 2. Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added `alternates: { canonical: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip' }` to metadata

### 3. Blog Page (`src/app/blog/page.tsx`)
- Added `alternates: { canonical: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip/blog' }` to metadata

### 4. Blog Post Page (`src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Added dynamic canonical URLs for individual blog posts: `https://www.aiasmr.vip/blog/${slug}`
- Added `url` to OpenGraph metadata for blog posts
- Added canonical URL for 404 case

### 5. Client Component Pages
Created layout files for client components that can't export metadata directly:

#### Create Page (`src/app/create/layout.tsx`)
- Added metadata with canonical URL: `https://www.aiasmr.vip/create`

#### Explore Page (`src/app/explore/layout.tsx`)
- Added metadata with canonical URL: `https://www.aiasmr.vip/explore`

#### My Videos Page (`src/app/my-videos/layout.tsx`)
- Added metadata with canonical URL: `https://www.aiasmr.vip/my-videos`

#### Pricing Page (`src/app/pricing/layout.tsx`)
- Added metadata with canonical URL: `https://www.aiasmr.vip/pricing`

### 6. Auth Pages
Updated existing metadata to include canonical URLs:

#### Login Page (`src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
- Added `alternates: { canonical: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip/auth/login' }`

#### Signup Page (`src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
- Added `alternates: { canonical: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip/auth/signup' }`

#### Auth Error Page (`src/app/auth/auth-code-error/page.tsx`)
- Added `alternates: { canonical: 'https://www.aiasmr.vip/auth/auth-code-error' }`

### 7. SEO Utilities (`src/lib/seo.ts`)
- Created utility functions for generating canonical URLs and metadata
- Added `generateCanonicalUrl()` function for consistent URL generation
- Added `generateMetadata()` function for standardized metadata creation
- Added common metadata constants

### 8. Robots.txt (`src/app/robots.ts`)
- Created robots.txt file to guide search engine crawling
- Disallowed sensitive routes like `/api/`, `/auth/`, `/my-videos/`
- Referenced sitemap location

### 9. Sitemap (`src/app/sitemap.ts`)
- Created XML sitemap for better search engine indexing
- Included all major pages with appropriate priorities and change frequencies
- Added blog post URLs

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Duplicate Content Issues**: Canonical URLs tell search engines which version of a page is the "official" one
2. **Improves SEO Rankings**: Proper canonical URLs help search engines understand page relationships
3. **Better Social Media Sharing**: OpenGraph URLs ensure proper social media previews
4. **Enhanced Crawling**: Robots.txt and sitemap.xml help search engines discover and index pages efficiently
5. **Consistent URL Structure**: All pages now follow a consistent canonical URL pattern

## Testing

- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ All pages have proper metadata
- ✅ Canonical URLs are correctly set for all routes
- ✅ Dynamic routes (blog posts) have proper canonical URLs
- ✅ Client components have metadata through layout files

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to production
2. Monitor search console for any canonical URL issues
3. Consider implementing dynamic sitemap generation for blog posts
4. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for enhanced search results
