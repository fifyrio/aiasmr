- `DELETE /api/videos/:id`
- `POST /api/videos/bulk` (with action, ids)
- `GET /api/user/credits` (returns balance and usage stats)

---

## 5. UI/UX Design

- **Responsive layout**: Switch grid/list based on screen size
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels on buttons, keyboard-friendly focus states
- **Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/failure of actions
- **Confirmation modals**: For delete and regenerate, highlight credit impact

---

## 6. Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements

- **Performance**: Handle pagination across hundreds of videos
- **Reliability**: Regenerate jobs should preserve original configurations
- **Scalability**: Support future filtering by model version, tags, etc.
- **Security**: Only allow access to videos belonging to authenticated user
- **Logging**: Track user video actions for audit and support

---

## 7. Metrics to Track

- Total videos per user
- Regeneration frequency
- Delete rate
- Processing success/failure ratio
- Average credits per video

## 8. MVP vs Future Enhancements

### MVP
- Single-video view mode, basic sorting/filtering, preview/download/regeneration

### Phase 2
- Bulk edit, bulk deletion, regeneration queue management

### Phase 3
- Tag editing, custom titles, video sharing to public or social platforms

### Phase 4
- Analytics dashboard: per-video stats like view count, shares, average watch time

## ‚úÖ Summary
The **My Videos** page forms the backbone of the user‚Äôs journey, giving them clarity and control over their creations, usage, and credits‚Äîwhile laying a solid foundation for future enhancements.
