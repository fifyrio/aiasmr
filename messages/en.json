      "questions": {
        "effective": {
          "question": "What makes ASMR effective for relaxation?",
          "answer": "ASMR triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering heart rate and cortisol levels. Gentle, repetitive sounds and visuals create a meditative state that naturally reduces stress and anxiety."
        },
        "sleep": {
          "question": "Can ASMR really help with sleep problems?",
          "answer": "Yes! Studies show ASMR can improve sleep quality by reducing racing thoughts, muscle tension, and anxiety. The slow, rhythmic nature of relaxing ASMR naturally prepares your mind and body for rest."
        },
        "bestTime": {
          "question": "What's the best time to watch relaxing ASMR?",
          "answer": "Evening hours (1-2 hours before bed) are ideal for sleep-focused content. For stress relief, any time you feel overwhelmed works. Morning sessions can set a calm tone for your entire day."
        },
        "headphones": {
          "question": "Do I need special headphones for relaxing ASMR?",
          "answer": "While any headphones work, comfortable over-ear or high-quality earbuds enhance the experience. Avoid noise-canceling for bedtime use, as you want to remain aware of your environment."
        },
        "volume": {
          "question": "What's the optimal volume for relaxing ASMR?",
          "answer": "Keep volume low - around 20-30% of your device's maximum. The sounds should be clearly audible but not dominating. If you can't hear gentle background noises, it's too loud."
        },
        "anxiety": {
          "question": "Can ASMR help with anxiety and depression?",
          "answer": "ASMR can be a helpful complementary tool for managing anxiety and mild depression symptoms. The relaxation response and sense of personal attention can provide comfort, though it's not a replacement for professional treatment."
        },
        "tingles": {
          "question": "Why don't I feel ASMR tingles?",
          "answer": "Not everyone experiences tingles, and that's completely normal! You can still benefit from the relaxation, stress relief, and sleep improvement that ASMR provides, even without the tingling sensation."
        },
        "frequency": {
          "question": "How often should I watch relaxing ASMR?",
          "answer": "Daily viewing is safe and beneficial. Many people incorporate ASMR into their nightly routine or use it during stressful periods. Listen to your body and adjust frequency based on your needs."
        },
        "triggers": {
          "question": "What triggers work best for deep relaxation?",
          "answer": "Gentle tapping, soft brushing sounds, whispered speech, page turning, and nature sounds are highly effective. Personal preference varies, so experiment to find your most relaxing triggers."
        },
        "safety": {
          "question": "Is it safe to fall asleep to ASMR videos?",
          "answer": "Yes, it's perfectly safe! Many videos are designed specifically for sleep. Use a sleep timer to conserve battery, and ensure your device won't disturb you with notifications or autoplay."
